# Human Evaluation Rubric for Analytical Reports

This rubric provides guidelines for human evaluators to score analytical reports consistently. The evaluation is based on five key criteria, with scores assigned on a scale of 1-20 for each criterion, resulting in a total score out of 100.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Structure and Organization (0-20 points)
Assess how well the report is structured and organized.

| Score Range | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 16-20 | **Excellent**: Clear logical structure with well-organized sections and perfect flow. Information is presented in a coherent sequence with effective use of headings, subheadings, and transitions. |
| 11-15 | **Good**: Generally well-organized with only minor issues in structure. Good use of headings and sections, but some transitions may be abrupt or sections slightly imbalanced. |
| 6-10 | **Average**: Basic structure exists but lacks clarity in organization. Some sections may be out of logical order or information is not grouped effectively. |
| 0-5 | **Poor**: Disorganized, confusing structure that is hard to follow. Lacks clear sections or logical progression of ideas. |

### 2. Depth of Analysis (0-20 points)
Evaluate the thoroughness and insight of the analysis.

| Score Range | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 16-20 | **Excellent**: Comprehensive analysis with nuanced insights that considers multiple perspectives. Goes beyond surface-level observations to reveal meaningful patterns or implications. |
| 11-15 | **Good**: Solid analysis with some insightful points. Explores most key aspects of the topic with adequate detail. |
| 6-10 | **Average**: Basic analysis that covers obvious points but lacks deeper insights. Limited exploration of complexities or alternative viewpoints. |
| 0-5 | **Poor**: Superficial analysis that misses key aspects. Focuses mainly on describing rather than analyzing. |

### 3. Use of Evidence (0-20 points)
Assess how effectively evidence and data are used to support claims.

| Score Range | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 16-20 | **Excellent**: Strong evidence throughout with proper citations. Uses a variety of credible sources and data points. Evidence directly supports all major claims. |
| 11-15 | **Good**: Good use of evidence in most sections. Most claims are supported by relevant data or citations, though some evidence may be less compelling. |
| 6-10 | **Average**: Some evidence provided but inconsistent. Key claims may lack sufficient support or evidence is of questionable relevance/quality. |
| 0-5 | **Poor**: Little to no evidence, or evidence is irrelevant or unreliable. Claims are largely unsupported. |

### 4. Logical Reasoning (0-20 points)
Evaluate the quality of reasoning and the logical connections between evidence and conclusions.

| Score Range | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 16-20 | **Excellent**: Flawless reasoning where conclusions directly follow from evidence. Arguments are consistently sound with no logical fallacies. |
| 11-15 | **Good**: Generally sound reasoning with minor gaps. Most arguments are valid and conclusions generally follow from premises. |
| 6-10 | **Average**: Basic logical flow but with some unsubstantiated leaps or minor logical fallacies. Connections between evidence and conclusions are sometimes unclear. |
| 0-5 | **Poor**: Poor reasoning with major logical fallacies. Conclusions don't follow from evidence or contradict available data. |

### 5. Clarity and Presentation (0-20 points)
Assess the clarity of writing and overall presentation quality.

| Score Range | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 16-20 | **Excellent**: Exceptionally clear writing with professional presentation. Ideas are expressed precisely with appropriate terminology. Excellent use of visual elements if present. |
| 11-15 | **Good**: Clear writing with occasional unclear passages. Generally appropriate use of terminology and good presentation. |
| 6-10 | **Average**: Generally understandable but with frequent clarity issues. Some confusing sentences or inappropriate word choices. Basic presentation. |
| 0-5 | **Poor**: Confusing writing with poor presentation. Frequent grammatical errors or inappropriate language. Poor or missing visual elements if needed. |

## Overall Quality Score Interpretation

The overall score is the sum of points from all five criteria (maximum 100 points).

| Overall Score | Interpretation |
|---------------|----------------|
| 90-100 | **Exceptional**: Outstanding in all aspects. Sets the standard for excellence in analytical reporting. |
| 80-89 | **Excellent**: Very strong with only minor flaws. Demonstrates sophisticated analysis and presentation. |
| 70-79 | **Good**: Solid report with some notable weaknesses. Effective in most aspects but needs improvement in specific areas. |
| 50-69 | **Average**: Acceptable but substantial improvements needed. Meets basic requirements but lacks depth or rigor in multiple areas. |
| 30-49 | **Below Average**: Major weaknesses in multiple areas. Barely meets minimal standards for analytical reports. |
| 0-29 | **Poor**: Fails to meet basic standards for analytical reports. Ineffective in most or all evaluation criteria. |
