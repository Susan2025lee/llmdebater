**Switching Costs Evaluation Framework**

| Evaluation Factor                 | Analysis / Observation (For the specific company/industry)                               | Strength Assessment (High/Medium/Low) | Supporting Evidence / Key Notes                                                                                                         |

| 1. Product/Service Integration    | *How deeply embedded is the product/service in the customer's daily operations or life?* |                                       | *e.g., Mission-critical system (ERP, core banking), daily workflow tool, peripheral service? Level of customization?* |
| 2. Procedural Costs (Time & Effort) | *Describe the complexity, time, and effort required for a customer to migrate.* |                                       | *e.g., Data migration needs (volume, complexity)? Retraining required (how many people, how long)? New process setup? Installation time?* |
| 3. Financial Costs                | *Estimate direct costs incurred by switching (fees, new hardware/software).* |                                       | *e.g., Contract termination fees? Cost of new licenses/equipment? Implementation service costs?* |
| 4. Compatibility & Integration    | *Assess difficulty in making a new solution work with existing systems.* |                                       | *e.g., Use of proprietary standards? Lack of open APIs? Dependence on specific hardware/OS?* |
| 5. Relational & Psychological Costs | *Evaluate loss of relationships, trust, loyalty benefits, or comfort level.* |                                       | *e.g., Loss of dedicated support? Forfeiture of loyalty points/status? Comfort with the familiar interface/process? Brand affinity?* |
| 6. Risk of Switching            | *Consider the perceived risk (performance, reliability) of adopting a new solution.* |                                       | *e.g., Is the incumbent highly reliable? Is the alternative unproven? Potential for disruption during switchover?* |
| 7. Network Effects                | *Does switching mean losing access to a valuable network or user base?* |                                       | *e.g., Social platforms, marketplaces, communication standards.* |
| **Quantitative Indicators (Proxies)** |                                                                                          |                                       |                                                                                                                                         |
| 8. Customer Churn Rate          | *Report the rate at which customers leave. Compare vs. industry/peers.* |                                       | *e.g., Annual Churn Rate = X%. Trend over time (stable, increasing, decreasing)? How does it compare to competitors' churn?* |
| 9. Pricing Power Indicators       | *Evidence of ability to raise prices without significant customer loss.* |                                       | *e.g., History of price increases relative to inflation/competitors? Stable/increasing gross & operating margins?* |
| 10. Recurring Revenue (%)       | *What portion of revenue is predictable (subscriptions, long-term contracts)?* |                                       | *e.g., % of Revenue Recurring = Y%. Average contract length? Auto-renewal common?* |
| 11. Market Share Stability      | *Assess the company's market share trend over time.* |                                       | *e.g., Stable or growing market share despite competitor actions or price increases? Resilience to new entrants?* |
| **Overall Assessment** | **Summarize the findings: Are the switching costs, on balance, a strong moat?** | **(Assign Overall: High/Medium/Low)** | **Justify the overall assessment based on the key factors identified above. Note any potential threats or eroding factors.** |

This table provides a structured way to analyze the different facets of switching costs and arrive at a reasoned conclusion about their strength as an economic moat for the company being evaluated.
