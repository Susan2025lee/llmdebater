| Factor / Metric             | Measurement                                                                                                | Indication of Loyalty & Moat Strength                                                                                                                               |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Customer Retention Rate** | Percentage of customers who remain active purchasers over a specific period (e.g., annually). Inverse of Churn Rate. | A high rate signifies satisfaction and consistent preference, creating a stable revenue base and reducing the need for costly customer acquisition (Strong Moat). |
| **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**| Survey score (-100 to +100) asking customers how likely they are to recommend the brand.                    | A high score indicates strong customer satisfaction and willingness to advocate, suggesting deep loyalty and organic growth potential (Strengthens Moat).        |
| **Purchase Frequency** | Average number of times a customer purchases from the brand within a defined period.                       | High frequency suggests habitual buying and strong preference over alternatives, contributing to predictable revenue and market share stability (Supports Moat).    |
| **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** | Projected total net profit a company will earn from a customer throughout their entire relationship.       | A high CLV reflects sustained loyalty and profitability per customer, indicating the long-term economic benefit derived from the loyal base (Quantifies Moat Value). |
| **Price Premium Capability**| The brand's ability to charge higher prices than competitors for comparable products without losing significant sales volume. | Willingness to pay more signals strong perceived value, trust, and brand preference, enabling higher profit margins (Direct Moat Benefit).                    |
| **Share of Wallet** | The percentage of a customer's spending within a specific product category that is allocated to the brand.     | A high share indicates the brand is the dominant choice for the customer in its category, limiting competitor access and showing strong preference (Defends Moat).   |
| **Customer Engagement** | Metrics tracking interactions: social media activity (likes, shares, comments), loyalty program usage, community participation, email engagement. | High engagement suggests an emotional connection and brand investment beyond mere transactions, fostering a resilient customer base less likely to switch (Deepens Moat). |
| **Upsell / Cross-sell Rate**| Percentage of existing customers purchasing more expensive versions (upsell) or additional products/services (cross-sell). | Success indicates trust in the brand's quality and value proposition, increasing revenue from the loyal base and demonstrating relationship depth (Enhances Moat).     |
| **Brand Advocacy / Referral Rate** | Tracking customer referrals (e.g., via codes) or positive unsolicited mentions/recommendations online and offline. | Active advocacy provides low-cost customer acquisition and powerful social proof, amplifying brand reach and reinforcing the moat's strength.                |
| **Market Share Stability** | Consistency or growth of the brand's market share over time, especially during competitive pressure or market shifts. | Stable or growing share often reflects a loyal customer base effectively defending the brand against rivals, though other market factors also play a role (Indicator of Moat Effectiveness). |
| **Resilience to Issues** | Qualitative assessment of customer base stability and sentiment following negative publicity, product recalls, or service failures. | Continued patronage despite problems points to deep-seated trust and emotional loyalty, showcasing the brand's resilience (Demonstrates Moat Durability).         |
